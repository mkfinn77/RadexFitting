# RadexFitting
Fitting RADEX (van der Tak et al. 2021) models to molecular line emission to create maps of physical parameters.

This methodology was used in Finn et al. (2021) to create maps of temperature, H2 density, and CO column density 
in the Molecular Ridge of the Large Magellanic Cloud with CO and 13CO emission. 

This package can now fit physical conditions from any molecular emission with the collision data needed to generate RADEX models.
It can fit not only the original temperature, density, and column, but also the beam filling factor and
abundance ratios between molecular species.

Download code and supporting files from the RADEXFittingCode folder and run TutorialNotebook.ipynb for an introduction to using the code.
